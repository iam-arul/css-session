2. `Margin vs Padding`  [source link](https://medium.com/frontendshortcut/margin-vs-padding-c1fc8ea8bfaf)
    - Margin is an element’s personal space — how much distance the element wants to keep with other elements around it.
    - Padding is how much an element is away from itself — how much distance an element wants to keep with the elements inside it.
    - It has testing tool (Developer tools)
    - They both are used to create gaps around elements, but they differ in their method of creating that gap. Margin accommodates the gap       by pushing adjacent elements away from it, while Padding accommodates the gap by either growing its own size or by shrinking the           size of content inside it.
